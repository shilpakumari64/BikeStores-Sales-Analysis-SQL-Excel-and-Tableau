The dataset used for this analysis is created in SQL. I have created a BikeStores database using SQL and populated it with data representing sales transactions, regions, stores, product categories, and brands. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of BikeStores' sales activities during the specified period.

## Tools Used

For this analysis, I utilized the following tools:

- SQL: Created the BikeStores database and performed queries to extract and transform the data.
